# Product Quality Defect Prediction

This project analyzes quality control data from a simulated life sciences manufacturing environment. It explores defect trends and uses a basic machine learning model to predict defect counts based on variables like shift, inspector, and machine.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Goals
- Visualize defect trends
- Build a regression model to predict defect count
- Generate insights for quality improvement

## How to Run
1. Open `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`
2. Install libraries from `requirements.txt`
3. Run cells to explore data and build the model
